        <h1>Overview of AKP</h1>
        The internet is undergoing a sea change. The dream: digital assets can be owned and transacted purely online. The challenges: privacy, security, and compliance. The blockchain space is no stranger to lofty dreams. The challenge is bridging dreams and reality.
        <br>
        <br>
        We provide products and services to systems designers, integrators, and operators to launch and maintain applications for the new internet.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our software development kit gives any web application or ecosystem the capabilities expected of a modern web3 solution. Components may be integrated by module or by functionality.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are few platforms that offer the power of compliant distributed ledger and privacy enhancing technologies as we do. Other similar platforms focus on providing only access to a technology stack as a tool but we provide access to a solution stack as both tools and services.
        <br>
        <br>
        We invest in training, coaching, and supporting students and startups with promising projects or learning potential. We sponsor hackathons, contests, and international competitions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our team is comprised of engineers and computer scientists with strategic partners that have seasoned experience in complex sales and key intellectual property in research and development.</p>
