        <br><li>A versatile working environment: our team worked remote before the pandemic and we work flexible hours; as long as work is done, no one cares how you plan your time.</li>
        <br><li>A fulfilling career: our work brings positive impact millions of our fellow humans worldwide and encourages others to extend that impact.</li>
        <br><li>A culture of excellence: besides our main roles, we regularly teach and train others (mostly pro bono) to remain sharp and at the top of our game.</li>
        <br><li>A diverse community: our multilingual and multicultural team hails from (literally) the farthest corners of the planet, benefiting from the best of many worlds.</li>
        <br><li>An egalitarian workplace: whether an intern or a unit leader, all teammates are treated with respect and dignity. Everyone makes their own coffee but we do take turns with the takeout!</li>
